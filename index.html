    <h1>A Tribute to the Love of My Life, Alexya</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>My Dearest Alexya,</p>

    <p>It’s often said that words can’t fully capture the depth of our feelings, and in this moment, as I try to express just how much you mean to me, I find that sentiment to be true in ways I hadn’t expected. I think of you every single day—of your smile, your laugh, the way your eyes light up when you’re excited about something. I think about all the things that make you uniquely you, and it’s in those moments, even when we’re not together, that I feel a peace in my heart. But I also know I’ve made mistakes. I’ve been harsh, distant, and unfair at times. And though I cannot undo the hurt I may have caused, I want to tell you from the very core of my being how sorry I am. My behavior, especially in recent days, has not been a reflection of the love I feel for you, and I need to take full responsibility for that. I have hurt you, and for that, my heart aches. But I also want you to know that I am truly, deeply committed to making things right. I want to love you in the way you deserve—unconditionally, completely, and with all of my heart.</p>

    <p>I’ve reflected so much on our journey together, from the very first time we met to the present moment. The memories we’ve created, the laughter we’ve shared, the quiet moments where it was just us two against the world—those are the moments I hold closest to my heart. I am in awe of the love you give me, the patience you show me, and the strength you embody in everything you do. You’re my support, my light, and my grounding force. You make me want to be a better person every day, and I know I’ve let you down by not living up to that standard. I realize now that I’ve sometimes allowed my own frustrations and emotional walls to block the love I should have shown you. When I think back on those moments, I feel a deep regret for not appreciating you fully, for not showing you in every way how much you mean to me. You deserve to be treated with kindness, respect, and endless affection. I failed to give you that in certain moments, and I am truly sorry for making you feel less than cherished. That was never my intention, and it breaks my heart to think I’ve made you feel otherwise.</p>

    <div class="apology">
      <p class="highlight">Alexya, I need you to know, from the bottom of my heart, how deeply sorry I am. I recognize that I’ve been emotionally distant at times, that I’ve let small issues grow into bigger problems, and that I’ve been too prideful to admit when I was wrong. I know I’ve let you down, and I understand that my actions may have hurt you more than I could ever imagine. What I want you to know is that I regret every moment that I’ve caused you pain, and I wish I could take back every word or action that has left a scar. You don’t deserve that. You deserve a love that uplifts you, that makes you feel like the most important person in the world. I’m sorry for every moment where I failed to give you that. My love for you is so deep, and I am committed to showing you that through my actions, not just my words. I want to rebuild the trust we’ve had, and I’ll do everything in my power to earn back the trust I’ve lost. Your love means the world to me, and I will work tirelessly to make sure you always feel valued and adored.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Even though I’ve hurt you, I hope you know that my heart belongs to you. I can’t imagine a future without you in it, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to prove my love to you. I want us to grow stronger, to face life’s challenges together, and to build something beautiful that we can both be proud of. Whether it’s traveling to new places, creating a home together, or simply sharing quiet moments in each other’s arms, I want to experience all of that with you. No matter where you want to go, no matter what you want to do, I’m ready to go there with you. If there’s a way I can make it up to you, I’m more than willing to do whatever it takes. I’ll go anywhere, I’ll do anything, as long as I have you by my side. You are my world, Alexya, and I’m committed to doing everything in my power to show you how much I love you.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, when I think of how much I’ve taken for granted, it hits me like a wave. You’ve always been there for me, always understanding, always forgiving. And I can’t take that for granted anymore. You deserve a love that’s as strong as the love you’ve given me, and that’s what I want to give you from now on. I’ll be more patient, more attentive, and more aware of how my actions affect you. I promise you, I will always work hard to be the partner you deserve—the partner who listens, who supports, who shows love in ways that leave no room for doubt. Because you deserve that, Alexya. You deserve nothing less than the best of me. And I will spend every day showing you how much you mean to me. I will never stop trying to be better for you, because I love you more than words can express.</p>

    <p>My love, I am so sorry for the times I’ve hurt you. Please know that every day, I am working on myself to be the man who can give you the love you truly deserve. I don’t want to just apologize, I want to change. And I need you to know that no matter what happens, no matter where we go, I’m with you. I’m here for you, always, and I will continue to fight for us, for our love, and for the life we deserve. You mean everything to me, Alexya. I will spend the rest of my life proving that to you.</p>

    <p>Forever yours,</p>
    <p><strong>Bichette</strong></p>

    <p>🩵🖤Happy New Year, my love! 🎉🖤🩵</p>

    <p>As we step into this new year, I can’t help but reflect on the incredible journey we’ve shared since that October 28. Calling you my baby brings so much joy to my heart, and though I sometimes play it cool, hearing you call me bichette always melts my heart.</p>

    <p>We've experienced our fair share of ups and downs, including that Friday I’ve dubbed the horrifying Friday. Yet, I forgave you without hesitation, because all I ever wanted was to be with you. You mean the world to me, Alexya. Your love, your quirks, and even the moments that frustrate me. These are all part of what makes you who you are, and I cherish every bit of you.</p>

    <p>I envision our future together, I dream of traveling to Dubai with you, exploring new places, and creating marvelous memories. Whether it's experiencing new cultures or simply enjoying each other's company, I see us embarking on many more journeys around the world.</p>

    <p>Even when you piss me off, I find myself loving that side of you too. I hate it, but it’s like that. At the end of the day, I love you entirely: the good, the bad, and everything in between. I want us to build a beautiful life together, filled with happiness and love. Whether it's in the US with our four kids, including our little joke Anael, or anywhere else, my only wish is to be with you.</p>

    <p>Never forget how much I love you. I would move mountains for you, and my biggest goal is to be the best man I can be for you.</p>

    <p>Here's to a year filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities together. I love you more than words can ever express, and I can't imagine my life without you.</p>

    <p>Forever yours,</p>
    <p><strong>Bichette</strong></p>
